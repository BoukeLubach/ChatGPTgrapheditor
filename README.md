# Chatgpt graphbuild

## Project Description:

This project creates a React page that connects to an API to generate and display graphs using Plotly.js. It handles user input for conversations with ChatGPT, rendering chat dialogs and graphs. The API's responses are directly used to render graphs.
The initial system prompt instructs ChatGPT to generate specific plot data objects. The project discusses the benefits of using NLP for graph adjustment, highlights potential downsides, and suggests future applications.
Integrating NLP enhances the user experience, automating graph adjustments and offering room for further app improvements.
